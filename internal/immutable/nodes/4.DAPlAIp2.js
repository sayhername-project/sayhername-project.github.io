        States. The event, titled ‘Her Dream Deferred,’ offered daily streaming of panel discussions accompanied by 
        real-time Twitter conversations. #HerDreamDeferred, evocative of Langston Hughes’s 1951 poem about the 
        Black nihilism of Harlem, did not resonate widely as a hashtag, but the first day’s webcast conversation, 
        on Monday, March 30, 2015, included a different one, #SayHerName, concise enough to gain popularity.”</p> <p class="cite svelte-8u0e56">Jackson, S. J., Bailey, M., & Foucault Welles, B. (2020). #HashtagActivism: Networks of race and gender

        how their words, tone, and actions may have been received and understood by others within the online public sphere.</p> <p>By manually scraping and coding a sample of 3,000 tweets, four key motivational patterns were extracted that 
        illustrate why users chose to participate: calling for action, sharing information, amplifying stories, 
        or remembering those lives lost. Complementing this, three key behavioral patterns were discovered that 
        explore how users felt about the conversation: outrage against a broken system, unifying others under this

        became a central space for memorialization and a driving force in the fight for justice for Black 
        women and girls who were victims of policy brutality. Thousands of people tweeted daily, using the 
        hashtag to share stories, express solidarity, and amplify calls for accountability. As the AAPF 
        described, the "#SayHerName campaign was born to cut through this disturbing reality and resist the 
        invisibility of Black women, girls, and femmes by telling their story of police violence."</p> <p>Across the United States, the movement inspired protests, vigils, and community gatherings that 
        mourned lives lost and demanded systemic change, capturing national and international audiences who 
        stood in solidarity with its message. During this period, hashtag activism emerged as a powerful form 
        of repeated resistance–an evolving digital strategy through which users spread information, raised awareness, 
        and connected local struggles to a broader fight for racial and gender justice.</p> <p class="cite svelte-7qjsk">African American Policy Forum.
