        Since its emergence in 2015, the hashtag #SayHerName has stood as a powerful call for justice–
        amplifying the voices and stories of Black women and girls whose encounters with policy violence 
        have too often been ignored. This section of the project examines how the movement took shape on 
        Twitter during its formative year, uncovering patterns of participation, emotion, and community that 
        defined its rise.
