    <h2>The Rise of the #SayHerName Movement</h2>
    <p>
        “In 2015, the African American Policy Forum, cofounded by [Kimberlé] Crenshaw and Columbia Law School, 
        hosted a weeklong webinar series dedicated to discussing the state of Black women and girls in the United 
        States. The event, titled ‘Her Dream Deferred,’ offered daily streaming of panel discussions accompanied by 
        real-time Twitter conversations. #HerDreamDeferred, evocative of Langston Hughes’s 1951 poem about the 
        Black nihilism of Harlem, did not resonate widely as a hashtag, but the first day’s webcast conversation, 
        on Monday, March 30, 2015, included a different one, #SayHerName, concise enough to gain popularity.”
